AI art has quickly become one of the most talked about topics in the town.

There are many of these AI generators out there, such as [Dalle-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/), [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release), and especially the new version of [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F) (v4), which is capable of producing unbelievable results and has quickly become super addictive.

I have used it to generate photorealistic Polaroids, film photos from the 80s, and even futuristic imaginations. I have also asked it to generate graphic design, including websites, apps, dashboards UIs, movie posters, book covers, logos, and billboard ads â€” the possibilities are endless.

Despite some quirks, these AI-generated works are great sources of inspiration and provide a solid foundation for designers looking to get started.

_Here are some examples (with prompts) that I made using Midjourney._
