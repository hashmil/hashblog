I have been struggling with the decision to include a comment section in my blogâ€”and Twitter appears to be the answer. WordPress already comes with a comment section, and there are other fantastic plug-ins such as [Disqus](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/disqus-comment-system/) that integrates social elements and essentially becomes a comment section on steroids. Yet, managing these comments sections seemed too much work.

#### The plug-in to the rescue

Then I remembered seeing how discussions were handled at the [AVC blog](https://avc.com/) by Fred Wilson.

As mentioned in the [AVC blog article](https://avc.com/2020/01/avc-3-0/)â€”Twitter is a naturally good place to host discussions. And [Nick Grossman](https://www.theslowhunch.net/2020/the-discuss-on-twitter-wordpress-plugin/) developed a neat little [plug-in for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/discuss-on-twitter/)â€”which is built on top of the functionality of [WP to Twitter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-to-twitter/)â€”another plug-in that automatically tweets about your new blog postsâ€”which is what's been used on the AVC blog too:

#### The Installation

Setting it up was relatively straight-forwardâ€”yet needed a little extra setup with a [developer account on Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access) and also some tinkering with the PHP and CSS so the buttons show up below my blog posts just the way I wanted it.

Nick's plugin gives a neat little PHP snippet to add to your single post theme files such as `single.php` :

```php
<?php
	if (function_exists('discuss_on_twitter_button')) {
		discuss_on_twitter_button();
	}
?>
```

But I didn't want to mess with it, as [I built](https://hashir.blog/2021/02/how-to-set-up-an-easy-minimalist-blog/) my templates with Elementor. I could've created a shortcode in `functions.php` ([source](https://wpcodeus.com/how-to-add-php-code-to-elementor/)):

```php
// Shortcode to output custom PHP in Elementor
function wpc_elementor_shortcode( $atts ) {
	if (function_exists('discuss_on_twitter_button')) { discuss_on_twitter_button();
}
add_shortcode(
	'discuss_on_twitter_shortcode',
	'wpc_elementor_shortcode
);
```

This would allow me to use the shortcode within Elementor: `[discuss_on_twitter_shortcode]`

However, I opted to go down the lazy routeâ€”to use _another_ [plug-in](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/insert-ph) that inserted the PHP snippet for me. This meant that I didn't have to worry about child-themes or losing any customisations every time I updated WordPress.

#### Making it look good: The CSS customisation within Elementor

While the default look served the purpose, it was conflicting with the look-and-feel I was going for with this blog. I ended up tweaking it with the following CSS code:

```css
selector .discuss-on-twitter-button {
    font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;
    font-weight: 800;
    background-color: #262626;
    color: #FFFFFF;
    border-radius: 0;
    border-bottom: dotted 1px #FF5682;
    margin: 10px;
    padding: 6px 13px;
}

selector .discuss-on-twitter-button:hover {
    background-color: #FFFFFF;
    color: #000000;
    border-bottom: dotted 1px #000000;
}
```

Which made it look like this:

I've had to do some extra adjustments for other responsive sizes with some `@media` queries and `flex` adjustments. And I think I'm quite pleased with the end results.

If you feel like it, click on the buttons below to discuss on Twitter, or to just view the discussionâ€”if there's any at all! ðŸ˜…
