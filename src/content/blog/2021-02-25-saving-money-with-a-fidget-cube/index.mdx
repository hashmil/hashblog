Fidget cubes and fidget spinners were all the rage just a few short years ago. It was _the_ cool thing to have. Something that sparked off from a [crowdfunding project](https://www.headspacegroup.co.uk/how-crowdfunding-helped-create-the-fidget-cube/#:~:text=First%20designed%20in%202012%2C%20it,Kickstarter%20and%20Backer%20Designed%20editions.), ended up being copied to oblivion by Chinese factories.

The fad might have faded away. But the fidgeting hasn't stopped. People still play with pen lids, click their pens, and bite their nails and. People still like clicky keyboards—just look at the mechanical keyboard community. Tactile stuff gets people excited.

A few years ago my friend and ex-creative partner [Ryan](https://www.instagram.com/afleetingframe/) and I came up with an idea to link a fidget cube to your bank account. What if every time you click, flip or play with the fidget spinner—a penny gets is added to your savings account.

Fidget around all day to mindlessly save—a little bit at a time. If a person could fidget once per second, that would work out to be £36 per hour. It might be a short change, but have it invest in a Stocks and Shares ISA—[Moneybox](https://www.moneyboxapp.com/) style—and over time that could build up to a healthy amount of savings.
