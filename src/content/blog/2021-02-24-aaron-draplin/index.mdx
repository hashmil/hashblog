If I had to pick just one designer whose work I really envyâ€”it has to be Aaron Draplin. His use of solid colours and thick lines make his work distinct and unique. Whenever you look at his design piecesâ€”be it a logo or a posterâ€”you can't but just drool over how visually stunning they look.

In my personal design work, I try to draw inspiration from Aaron. Especially how he designs his logosâ€”giving it a timeless lookâ€”almost as it was designed by early graphic design legends.

His [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/draplin/) account is something I'd definitely recommend a gander, especially if you are willing to scroll way back in time to see his amazing collections of '[lost graphic design](https://www.musicbed.com/blog/career/inspiration-from-the-junk-shop-questions-and-answers-with-aaron-draplin/)' work that he finds in scrapyards and yard sales.
