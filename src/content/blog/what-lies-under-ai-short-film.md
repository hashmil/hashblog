This is a short AI film I made in under 4 hours. It was for a competition where we had to make something in 48 hours. Work and life got in the way, so I had less than 4 hours.

The challenge was intense, but sometimes constraints force the most creative solutions. Working with AI tools like Midjourney, Runway, and various editing software, I managed to craft a narrative that explores themes of discovery and hidden depths.

## The Process

The entire film was created using:

- **Midjourney** for generating concept art and storyboards
- **Runway** for AI video generation
- **Adobe After Effects** for compositing and effects
- **Premiere Pro** for final editing and sound design

## Creative Challenges

With such a tight timeline, every decision had to be immediate and purposeful. The AI tools allowed for rapid iteration, but the real challenge was maintaining a coherent narrative thread throughout the piece.

The film explores what lies beneath the surface - both literally and metaphorically. It's about the hidden depths in all of us, the stories we don't tell, and the worlds that exist just out of sight.

## Technical Innovation

This project pushed the boundaries of what's possible with AI-assisted filmmaking in an extremely limited timeframe. The workflow had to be streamlined, with each tool serving a specific purpose in the pipeline.

The result is a piece that showcases not just the potential of AI in creative work, but also the importance of human creativity in guiding and shaping that potential into something meaningful.
