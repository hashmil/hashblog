Recently, Marvel launched the TV show Secret Invasion on Disney Plus. In an interesting twist, they used [AI animation for their opening title sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm3GtYvXasQ). Judging by the flickering nature of the animation, it's quite likely they used Deforum within Stable Diffusion. Alternatively, it's a direct image-to-image generation. But either way, it's clear that a great deal of human work has gone into the animation.

Animating with AI might sound like a walk in the park, but the reality is it takes a lot of trial and error to consistently get good results. Contrary to what many anti-AI folks think, there isn't a single magic button that instantly produces amazing art. [Deforum](https://github.com/deforum-art/deforum-stable-diffusion) is a handy tool in Stable Diffusion that lets you set prompts at different points in the timeline and control a 'camera' in 2D or 3D space. The user interface for controlling these isn't the most intuitive, but after some messing around, I reckon I've got the hang of it.

Here are some experiments I did and posted on my TikTok:

##### Spider-Man Miles Morales
