There are lots of cool things that get featured on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/e/50-most-upvoted-products). Rarely do I come across something that can impact or positively influence some part of my life. When I came across it first, I had glanced over the [listing for Audiblogs](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/audiblogs) and didn't think too much about it. Then I saw a few tweets about itâ€”and I realised that [Audiblogs](https://audiblogs.com/?ref=producthunt) was a gamechanger!

Yeah sure, [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) has a similar feature too. However, you are limited to listening to any of the articles within the Pocket app. With Audiblogs, you get a unique RSS feed that you can plugin into any podcast player, including my favourite Podcast player of choiceâ€”Overcast.

#### The Game-changer

I've previously written about how [I listen to a lot of podcasts in 2x](https://hashir.blog/2021/02/2x-speed-listening-has-changed-my-life/). This chrome extension has an AI reader narrating the text in a near humanlike way, you could mistake it for a real person. And yes, you can 2x this narration too!

I'm a lazy reader, and skim through a lot of articles I come across. I also huge collections of saved up articles on Pocket and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/hashir/GTD-f49cac57bd884e7eb325ac25c8b06663). The worst part is that I never go back and read those articles. However, now with Audiblogs, I can just load it up as a podcast, and 'read' them while doing chores or running errands.

#### Conclusion

At a time when there are so many new podcasts do we need more audio form content? To meâ€”the more the merrier! Apart from the obvious benefits for the visually impaired, I think that Audiblogs can bring more written form content to the massesâ€”especially to the lazy readers like me. It will also push podcasters and producers to up their game a bit, and I truly believe that good content will always bubble up and be shared and talked about eventually.

It's been a while since I have come across something this revolutionary. As of now, Audiblogs is free. Like with all free products there will come a time when this will endâ€”either when they can't afford the upkeep of all the tech and server costs to store and share all those AI generated audio files, or when someone [like Spotify eventually acquires them](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-11-10/how-spotify-is-strengthening-our-investment-in-podcast-advertising-with-acquisition-of-megaphone/). I just hope that they don't get acquired by Google or Apple and get lost into a black hole of nothingnessâ€”[anybody remember Bump?](https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/16/bump-mobile-contact-sharing-app-acquired-by-google-will-stay-alive-for-now/#:~:text=After%20raising%20nearly%20%2420%20million,will%20stay%20open%20for%20download.)
