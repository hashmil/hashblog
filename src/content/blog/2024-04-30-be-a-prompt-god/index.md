I've made tens of thousands of AI generations on Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Dall-E, and Firefly. Almost always, I get asked, "How did you prompt that?" The answer isn't straightforward. I rarely rely on Gen AI's slot machine-like output to give me a random image. Using tools like ControlNet, IP-adapter, and custom Loras (in Stable Diffusion), I've learnt how to _somewhat_ control the beast that is AI to get the output I want. Sometimes this work is very manual. That being said, sometimes I am lazy and just want a cool-looking image. And prompting is hard.

So I wrote this "super prompt" that gets GPT (or Claude/Llama/Gemini) to help me craft a good prompt based on my idea. It considers things like lighting conditions, weather, environment, colour palette, hues, mood, tone, visual theme, artistic style, etc. â€” all based on a figment of your idea.

Just copy and paste the entire text found in this link (works best with GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus, or Llama 3 70b), and then the LLM will prompt you for your idea.
