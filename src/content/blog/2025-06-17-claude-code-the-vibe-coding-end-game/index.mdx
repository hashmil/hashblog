I've been using AI to "vibe-code" for a while now. As a Creative Technologist, it's my job to see how new tech can build real things, fast. My journey with AI coding has had a few stages.

It started with just copy-pasting code from ChatGPT into my IDE. It worked, but it was slow. Then came tools like GitHub Copilot, which was a big step up with its tab completions.

After that, VS Code plugins like [Roo Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-code) and [Cline](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev) started appearing. The whole thing felt like it was leading to [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), the all-in-one AI IDE. It had Claude, GPT, Gemini, and open-source models all in one place. I use tools like this, and others like [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf), all the time to make cool prototypes.

#### I finally tried Claude Code.

A colleague kept telling me to try [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). I was put off at first because it was a command-line tool. I prefer working inside my editor. But then I found out I could run it directly inside VS Code or even Cursor. That was a game changer for me.

#### So I gave it a real test.

I decided to give it a proper test. I created a clean Next.js project and gave it a single, half-baked prompt: "make a portfolio for a developer."

What it did next was impressive. It created a full plan and a to-do list. Then it started working through that list, one task at a time. It was self-correcting, fixing its own bugs and even running the linter to fix formatting errors.

#### But it could do more than just write code.

I also installed a few helper tools for it. One of the main ones is [Puppeteer](https://github.com/merajmehrabi/puppeteer-mcp-server). This lets Claude Code open your project in a Chrome browser, navigate the site, scroll, and click on things. It can even take screenshots and pass them back to itself to analyse and fix visual problems.

In about 15 minutes, I had a complete website. It was fully built and published on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

#### So is this the end game for me?

I'm sure I could get a similar result with Cursor or Windsurf. They are powerful tools. But the way Claude Code planned the project and then executed that plan, step-by-step, felt different. It felt more like a partner or an assistant than a tool. Maybe a really good intern. That costed just $20 a month.

For now, I think I've found my new favourite way to code. I think I've found the end game.
