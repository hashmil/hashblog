To ensure your hero image is displayed as the share preview image (Open Graph image) on LinkedIn and Facebook when sharing your Astro blog post, you need to explicitly reference the image in the Open Graph meta tags, not just in your front matter or as a visible image in the post content.

Here’s how you can do it:

## 1. Use Open Graph Meta Tags

Open Graph meta tags are required by social media platforms to understand which image to use for previews. The most important tag is `og:image`, but you can also include `og:image:width` and `og:image:height` for better compatibility[1][2][3].

**Example:**

```xml
<meta property="og:image" content="https://yourdomain.com/path/to/hero-image.jpg" />
<meta property="og:image:width" content="1200" />
<meta property="og:image:height" content="630" />
```

Replace the `content` attribute with the full, public URL to your hero image.

## 2. Reference the Hero Image from Front Matter

If your hero image is referenced in your front matter (e.g., `heroImage: /images/my-hero.jpg`), you must ensure this value is used to populate the `og:image` tag in your Astro layout or page[4][5][6].

**Example in Astro:**

```astro
---
const { heroImage } = Astro.props;
---

```

This ensures the image path is resolved to a full URL, which is required by social media platforms.

## 3. Make Sure the Image is Publicly Accessible

The image must be available at the URL you provide. If your image is only referenced in front matter and not actually served at that URL (for example, because of build-time optimizations or incorrect paths), the social media platforms will not be able to load it[4][5][3].

**Checklist:**

- **Absolute URL:** Always use an absolute URL for the `og:image` tag.
- **Image Exists:** Ensure the image is present and accessible at the provided URL.
- **Image Size:** 1200×630 pixels is recommended for best results on most platforms[7][8][3].

## 4. Additional Tips

- **Twitter Card:** For Twitter/X, also include Twitter-specific meta tags for better control:

```xml
  <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://yourdomain.com/path/to/hero-image.jpg" />
```

- **Dynamic Generation:** If you want to automate or dynamically generate Open Graph images for each post, consider using tools like `astro-og-canvas`, `astro-og-image`, or Cloudinary integration[9][10][11].
- **Debugging:** Use Facebook’s Sharing Debugger or LinkedIn’s Post Inspector to test your meta tags and previews.

## Summary Table

| Step                     | Description                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Use Open Graph Meta Tags | Add `og:image`, `og:image:width`, and `og:image:height` in your `` |
| Reference Hero Image     | Populate `og:image` from your front matter heroImage field         |
| Absolute Image URL       | Ensure the image URL is absolute and publicly accessible           |
| Twitter Meta Tags        | Add `twitter:card` and `twitter:image` for Twitter/X compatibility |
| Test Sharing             | Use social media debuggers to validate your setup                  |

By following these steps, your hero image will be properly displayed as the share image on LinkedIn and Facebook when your blog post is shared[1][4][2].
