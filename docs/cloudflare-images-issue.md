Yes, the behavior is the same when deploying an Astro site to Cloudflare Pages: **images inside the `src/` directory (such as `src/blog`) must be imported as modules**, not referenced by string paths in your markup. This requirement is due to how Astro processes and bundles assets, and it does not change based on the deployment platform[2][4][5].

### Key Points

- **Astro's build process** always requires images in `src/` to be imported, so you must use:

  ```astro
  import myImage from '../blog/my-image.jpg';

  ```

  This is true both locally and on Cloudflare Pages[2][4].

- **Cloudflare Pages** simply builds your Astro project using the same commands and output directory as you would locally (`npm run build`, output in `dist`). It does not change how Astro handles asset imports or static files[2][4][5].

- **Direct string paths** (e.g., ``) will not work for images in `src/`—the build will fail or the images will not be found, regardless of whether you deploy to Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, Netlify, or any other host[2][4][8].

- **If you want to reference images by string path** (for example, for dynamic image URLs), you must place those images in the `public/` directory, which is copied as-is to the build output and served statically[2][4].

### In summary

Astro's image handling rules are consistent across all deployment targets, including Cloudflare Pages. The deployment platform does not alter how Astro expects you to reference or import images from `src/` versus `public/`[2][4][5].

## Why Astro Images Are Not Loading from `src/blog` Directory

When using Astro, images placed inside the `src/` directory (such as `src/blog`) **must be imported as modules** to be used in your components or pages. You cannot reference them directly as string paths in the `src` attribute of an `or` component. This is a common source of confusion, especially for developers trying to avoid the `public/` directory for image storage.

### How Astro Handles Images

- **Images in `public/`:**  
  Referenced by relative URL or string path (e.g., `/images/foo.jpg`). Astro does not optimize or process these images—they are simply copied as-is to the final build output[1][2][5].
- **Images in `src/`:**  
  Must be imported using ES module syntax. Astro can then optimize and process these images at build time. You cannot use a string path for these images in the `src` attribute[1][2][5][6].

### Correct Usage for Images in `src/blog`

Suppose you have an image at `src/blog/my-image.jpg`.  
**You must import it:**

```astro
---
// Import the image as a module
import myImage from '../blog/my-image.jpg';
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
---


```

- **Do not** use `or` for images in `src/`—this will not work and will throw an error[1][6].
- Astro's ``component expects the`src` prop to be an imported image module, not a string path[1][6].

### Why Direct String Paths Fail

Astro's build process does not expose files in `src/` as static assets. They must be imported so Astro can process and bundle them. If you reference them as strings, Astro cannot find or serve them, resulting in broken images[1][6].

> "Image's and getImage's src parameter must be an imported image or an URL, it cannot be a string filepath"[6].

### Dynamic Image Paths

If you want to store image paths in a database or frontmatter and use them dynamically, you **cannot** import them at runtime from `src/` due to how ES module imports work. You must either:

- Use the `public/` directory for such images, referencing them by string path.
- Pre-import all possible images and map the string keys to imported modules (not scalable for large numbers of images).
- Use remote URLs for images that can be referenced as strings.

### Summary Table

| Directory          | How to Reference in Astro             | Optimized by Astro | Can Use String Path? |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| `public/`          | `/images/foo.jpg`                     | No                 | Yes                  |
| `src/` (e.g. blog) | `import img from '../blog/foo.jpg'``` | Yes                | No                   |

## Solution

- **For optimized images:**  
  Import images from `src/blog` and use the imported variable as the `src` prop in `or`[1][6].
- **For dynamic or database-driven images:**  
  Store images in `public/` and reference them by string path, or use remote URLs.
